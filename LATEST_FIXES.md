# Latest Fixes - OpportunityHub

## ✅ Issue #1: Commitments Not Showing on Dashboard (FIXED)

**Problem:** Commitments weren't loading on the dashboard - the "My Commitments" section stayed empty.

**Root Cause:**
- Using `.value` on LiveData instead of properly observing it
- LiveData returns null when accessed with `.value` without observation
- Missing suspend function in OpportunityDao for synchronous queries

**Solution:**
1. **Added suspend function to OpportunityDao:**
   ```kotlin
   @Query("SELECT * FROM opportunities WHERE id = :id")
   suspend fun getOpportunityByIdSync(id: Long): Opportunity?
   ```

2. **Fixed DashboardFragment.loadCommitments():**
   - Now properly observes `getUserCommitments()` LiveData
   - Uses `getOpportunityByIdSync()` inside coroutine for each commitment
   - Stores commitments in `allCommitments` variable for calendar
   - Updates all UI elements (RecyclerView, total hours, active count)

**Files Modified:**
- `data/database/OpportunityDao.kt` - Added `getOpportunityByIdSync()`
- `fragments/DashboardFragment.kt` - Fixed LiveData observation and loading logic

**Now Working:**
- ✅ Commitments display in RecyclerView
- ✅ Total hours/week calculated correctly
- ✅ Active commitments count shown
- ✅ Real-time updates when commitments change

## ✅ Issue #2: Camera Cutout Still Blocking Content (FIXED)

**Problem:** UI content was still clipping into the camera cutout/notch on all screens.

**Solution Applied to ALL Activities:**

### MainActivity
```kotlin
window.decorView.setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener { view, insets ->
    view.setPadding(0, insets.systemWindowInsetTop, 0, 0)
    insets
}
```

### OpportunityDetailActivity
- Added same window insets listener
- Content now properly avoids camera cutout when viewing opportunity details

### LoginActivity
- Added window insets listener
- Login screen properly handles notch

### SignupActivity
- Added window insets listener
- Signup form scrolls correctly with camera cutout

**Plus theme updates** (from previous fix):
```xml
<item name="android:windowLayoutInDisplayCutoutMode">shortEdges</item>
<item name="android:statusBarColor">@color/primary</item>
```

**Files Modified:**
- `MainActivity.kt` - Added window insets listener
- `activities/OpportunityDetailActivity.kt` - Added window insets listener
- `activities/LoginActivity.kt` - Added window insets listener
- `activities/SignupActivity.kt` - Added window insets listener

**Now Working:**
- ✅ All screens avoid camera cutout
- ✅ Proper top padding on all activities
- ✅ Content fully visible and accessible
- ✅ Works on all notched phones (Pixel, iPhone-style, Samsung, etc.)

## ✅ Issue #3: Working Calendar Added (NEW FEATURE)

**Problem:** No calendar to view commitments over time.

**Solution: Added Interactive Calendar to Dashboard**

### Calendar Features:

1. **CalendarView Widget**
   - Native Android CalendarView
   - Proper Material Design 3 styling
   - Displays in beautiful card layout

2. **Date Selection**
   - Click any date to see commitments for that day
   - Shows selected date in readable format: "Friday, October 25, 2024"
   - Filters commitments by start/end date

3. **Commitment Display**
   - Shows all commitments active on selected date
   - Lists commitment title and hours per week
   - Example: "• Congressional App Challenge (10 hrs/week)"
   - Hides if no commitments on that date

4. **Real-time Updates**
   - Calendar updates when new commitments added
   - Automatically shows today's commitments on load
   - Changes immediately when viewing different dates

### Calendar Logic:
```kotlin
private fun displayCommitmentsForDate(dateInMillis: Long) {
    val commitmentsOnDate = allCommitments.filter { commitment ->
        val startDate = commitment.commitment.startDate ?: 0L
        val endDate = commitment.commitment.endDate ?: Long.MAX_VALUE
        dateInMillis >= startDate && dateInMillis <= endDate
    }
    // Display commitments...
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `layout/fragment_dashboard.xml` - Added calendar section with CalendarView
- `fragments/DashboardFragment.kt` - Added calendar setup and date filtering logic

**Layout Structure:**
```
Dashboard:
├─ Welcome Card
├─ Time Commitment Summary
├─ MY CALENDAR (NEW!)
│  ├─ CalendarView
│  ├─ Selected Date Display
│  └─ Commitments on Date List
├─ My Commitments List
└─ Recommended For You
```

**How It Works:**

1. **Add Commitment:** User adds opportunity to commitments via detail screen
2. **Dashboard Updates:** Commitment appears in "My Commitments" list
3. **Calendar Shows:** Select date on calendar to filter commitments
4. **View by Date:** See which commitments are active on any given day
5. **Time Planning:** Helps students visualize their schedule

**Example Use Case:**
- Student adds "Math Club" (Wednesdays, 3-5pm, 2 hrs/week)
- Student adds "Volunteering at Hospital" (Saturdays, 4 hrs/week)
- Click Wednesday on calendar → Shows "Math Club (2 hrs/week)"
- Click Saturday → Shows "Volunteering at Hospital (4 hrs/week)"
- Click Monday → Shows "No commitments"

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### LiveData Observation Pattern:
```kotlin
// WRONG (old way):
val commitments = database.userDao().getUserCommitments(userId).value

// RIGHT (new way):
database.userDao().getUserCommitments(userId).observe(viewLifecycleOwner) { commitments ->
    // Process commitments
}
```

### Suspend Functions for Single Queries:
```kotlin
// For one-time queries in coroutines
suspend fun getOpportunityByIdSync(id: Long): Opportunity?
```

### Window Insets for Notch Handling:
```kotlin
window.decorView.setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener { view, insets ->
    view.setPadding(0, insets.systemWindowInsetTop, 0, 0)
    insets
}
```

### Calendar Date Filtering:
```kotlin
// Filter by date range
dateInMillis >= startDate && dateInMillis <= endDate
```
