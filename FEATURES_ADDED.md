# Congressional App Challenge - Features Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the features added to your college opportunity tracking app to make it competitive for the Congressional App Challenge.

---

## BUGS FIXED

### 1. Calendar Commitments Bug ✅
**File:** `app/src/main/java/com/example/cac3/fragments/DashboardFragment.kt`
**Fix:** Fixed the date normalization logic to properly filter commitments by date
- Now correctly normalizes dates to midnight for accurate comparison
- Handles null dates gracefully (shows active commitments when dates not set)
- Clears text when no commitments to prevent showing "Commitments on this day:" with empty list

### 2. Hours Per Week Calculation
**Status:** Calculation logic is correct
**Note:** If hours are wrong, check the data being saved to commitments (likely opportunity data issue, not calculation issue)
